# WRKY-gene-Expression-profiling-by-array
Whole WRKY gene family transcription analysis in rice during biotic and abiotic stress.
Summary
The WRKY gene family plays a pivotal role in plants, influencing a range of biological processes from growth to response to stress. While ancient in origin, these genes have proliferated extensively in plants, with species like Arabidopsis and Rice possessing numerous copies. Our research zeroes in on the role of WRKY genes in Rice when faced with different strains of the fungus Magnaporthe grisea and osmotic stress. Through a custom microarray analysis, we've discovered significant involvement of WRKY genes under stress conditions, noticing minimal variation between host and non-host infections or tissue-specific responses to osmotic stress. Notably, we observed that certain WRKY genes are consistently co-regulated, suggesting a network of gene interactions, particularly under stress.

Keywords: Stress Response

Overall Design
Study entailed a detailed examination of 40 microarrays under 6 different conditions, encompassing non-host pathogens (BR29 and BR32), a host pathogen (FR13), and osmotic stress affecting leaves and roots at varying time intervals. We ensured reliability by analyzing two biological replicates for each condition, with each replicate undergoing 2 to 4 technical repetitions.
